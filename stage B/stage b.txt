assumptions to be met for linear regression:
- Linearity 
- Homoscedacity 
- Normality 
- Independence of Observations

Multiple linear regression:
- Collinearity 
- Polynomial Regression 
Measuring Regression performance 
- MAE (smaller MAE better model)
- Residual sum of squares (Lower RSS better model)
- R-squared (Co-efficient of determination)
